    "Bearing #audience in mind, the report below relegates technical implementation details to a short, high-level overview under 'Implementation'. In the zip file, I have attached two notebooks (`scratchpad.ipynb` and `graphsim.ipynb`) with stream-of-consciousness (read: messy) tests I performed while building the simulation, including testing the equivalence of spacetime diagrams of a 1D NaSch simulation implemented with numpy magic (as seen in class) and with the OOP approach I use below, flow tests for the graph implementation and others. I haven't figured out a `run pytest` workflow yet. Still, I spent most of my time performing sanity checks on the model, so tips there would be appreciated. \n",

    "I also spent a reasonable amount of time designing what I (hope) is an extensible network-based model for traffic. Still, I fell short, in my mind, on interesting empirical data collection. Some ideas/suggestions there would be fantastic too! \n"

    "For its history as the epicenter of the OPlatz pro-immigration protest and ongoing renown as a hotspot for fine caf√©s and cuisine, Oranienplatz has a relatively unsophisticated traffic system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to its sister-system Kotbusser Tor, of falafel and illicit SIM card-dealing renown, Oranienplatz has just two sets of traffic lights that coordinate traffic movements between Oranienstrasse, an arterial bilane linking the Kreuzberg neighborhood to the more extensive highway system, to Legeindamm Strasse, the twin single-lanes that link the nearest U-Bahns to the Turkish area. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a growing influx of residents around the neighborhood and increased congestion around late evenings, Oranienplatz needs an alternative strategy that coordinates its traffic lights. Such a strategy will improve the average traffic flow across the road system during its busiest hour, from 5 to 6 pm. \n",

    "In this report, we implement a simulation of Oranienplatz using data recently collected from the square and explore how to use a graph-based simulation model to explore traffic strategies."

    "### Simulation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "At its crux, the simulation implements a Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) simulation. A cellular automaton, the NaSch model positions cars with integer velocities along a road of discrete cells, moving cars along the road each 'step' (i.e. each second) according to a 'ruleset'. The ruleset captures the patterns of good driving behavior (drive below the speed limit, slow down if there is a car ahead) as well as the randomness in the real world (slowing down to not collide with a jaywalker). For a single road over time, the following spacetime diagram captures the traffic patterns that emerge: \n",

    "\n",
    "In the plot above, a segment of Oranienstrasse is simulated over 75 steps. Darker colors correspond to slower speeds, and dark patches indicate traffic jams drifting over the road, over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation generalizes the NaSch model by allowing for multiple NaSch streets through an object-oriented description of each component (Cars, Lanes, as well as Generators for new Cars and Terminals for Cars exiting the simulation) and a network graph that describes the connections between these components. In short, Oranienplatz's streets are broken up into Road segments, and one segment is connected to another if there is a possibility to turn onto it:\n",

    "Every second, cars proposing to move past the end of the road segment 'turn' by moving from one node (the current road segment) to another node (the next road, chosen with fixed probability). Traffic Lights coordinate turning by labeling nodes 'Red' and 'Green.' If a Car is on a Green node, it can choose outgoing nodes (ie, Roads) to turn to. The labeling works because two sets of intersecting Roads will have traffic lights that are *coupled*; there is a 'systolic' set of Roads and a 'diastolic' set, and where one set is Green, the other set must be Red:\n",

In contrast, green edges imply that cars can. The phase of both sets of lights is 25 seconds, set to the empirical value described below. Additionally, node sizes scale by the number of cars in each road segment - notice 'Dresden_1' shrink over time as cars move to 'Dresden_2'. \n",

This low flow rate remains for about 25 seconds, corresponding to the phase of the traffic light. This is a broad indicator of a traffic pile-up on the road segment. Simultaneously, 'Orplatz_1' does not experience the same precipitous drops. This is indicative of a relatively empty road. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is bounded by 'Terminal' nodes (marked using triangles outside the map) which collect cars that exit the simulation. Additionally, cars enter the simulation through 'Generator' nodes (marked using bordered circles outside the map) according to an arrival rate inputted according to an empirical prior.\n",

The white band, about 25 seconds tall, within the 'Orplatz_4' corresponds to a Red phase that we described above. Straight black bars indicate cars waiting to transfer road segments, and the traffic 'waves' remain visible within each lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this is a grid-based, discrete simulation of how traffic patterns form over time. Its compactness of description allows us to test different traffic strategies through repeated trials quickly. However, its assumptions must also be laid bare:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 1-second Steps. Cars update positions and switch lanes every second. In practice, decisions on the road are not taken each second but are taken continuously. \n",
    "2. Integer Velocity. Each car travels at an integer velocity and correspondingly accelerates and decelerates with integer values. In reality, we expect to see more smoothness in the transition of velocities: the simulation converts a smooth position-time graph for a car into a kind of step function. \n",
    "3. Perfect Information and Good Behavior. Car behavior is modeled under the assumption of a kind of 'hyperawareness': each Car knows both the exact position of the next Car, but also their speed, its own speed, and the speed limit of the road. \n",
    "4. Boundaries and Arrival Rates. As we cannot simulate the entirety of Berlin, the simulation is bounded using Terminal and Generator nodes. These Generator nodes have a fixed generation rate. Since the simulation is designed to simulate just one hour, this is a fair assumption but limits its extensibility to multiple hours, as we expect phases to change over the day. \n",
    "5. Straight Lines. The simulation approximates roads as straight lines, with distances in the multiples of 5 meters. This is a fair approximation at the scale of a large city square, such as Oranienplatz, but not so much for smaller simulations with plenty of curved streets."

    "## Theoretical Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "Before testing strategies, we need a theoretical baseline to benchmark results against. Earlier, we mentioned that a Car at the end of a green Road chooses randomly between the next nodes, owing to the fact that the model does not have priors or distributions over transit journeys. We can make use of this fact to represent the simulation as a Markov model, where an initial distribution $u_0$ of cars on each Roads is updated to a later distribution $u_n$ by multiplying with the transition matrix $M^nu_0$. To set up this transition matrix, we first filter out Terminal Nodes (which simply collect cars), collect the graph's adjacency matrix, add the matrices transpose to itself, and then normalize to form a valid Markov transition matrix. Crucially, we add the adjacency matrix to its transpose to create 'loops': these loops are what will give the distributions $u_n$ periodicity, but also allow for a valid matrix that can be normalized. The stationary distribution, the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1, that the model converges to is summarized visually below:\n",

Generators, who simply generate cars and push then onto vacant Roads, converge to near emptiness, as we would expect. Oranien_4, as we have seen earlier, tends to fill up and stay full. Over a full run of 1 hour, this average flow rate plot shows promising correspondance between the Markov baseline and the simulation implementation: \n",

    "## Iterating Through Traffic Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "We test out 5 different traffic light phases, ranging from 10 seconds to 50 seconds. To obtain better results, the simulation was repeated over 100 trials for each prospective traffic light phase, and the mean and confidence interval of the mean flow rate, across all lanes, is plotted. In each trial, we additionally sample only the last few minutes of the hour, to ensure that each lane has reached a 'steady state' behavior. \n",

For example, the original phase duration of 20 seconds has seemingly the highest flow rate, but the confidence intervals enclose all other phase durations. Notably, the confidence intervals seem to grow as we increase the phase duration, perhaps because pile-ups towards the ends of Red roads have a higher chance to form. \n",
