This is also constrained to be positive, so 95% of our half-Normal will lie within [0, 10] ppm/year, which is a fairly large parameter space. We choose a normal because the probability density increases as we approach 0, and from the data exploration we know that the growth is around 1-2 ppm/year. Simultaneously, we don't want to underweigh the importance of the data with a sharp prior, so we let the distribution gradually lengthen out over the parameter space.\n",

First, a negative amplitude is simply a reflection about the x-axis. Second, the phase space of its period (1 year) is explored within a [$-\\pi$ , $\\pi$] phase shift (paramter $c_3$). In other words, it is self-similar under constrained parameters. This is a boon when using MCMC methods for posterior sampling (as we soon will), as it signigicantly reduces the number of first-order moments the sampler typically fixates on (and samples poorly as a result). Following a coincidentally identical rationale above, we use a positive-constrained Normal centered at 0, with a standard deviation of 5. \n",

We don't have any intuitions on the phase shift, so we use a flat distribution constrained to be in the range of [$-\\pi$, $\\pi$]. The author likes to call this a uniform *pi*er.

An Inverse-Gamma distribution is appropriate for this parameter, with a shape parameter of 0 and a scale parameter of 0.1, as it distributions the majority of its mass within the range [0, 0.1] ppm. This is positively constrained and very sharp, as we know that noise plays a very modest role in the trend. "
