    "# Model: WeightedCA \n",
    "\n",
    "The WeightedCA model builds off of the WCA2D model (Guidolin et al.) to simulate flooding over surface terrain using a 2D CA and weight-based transition rules. The model is quasi-physical, solving simple shallow-water equations while using a weighting system to speed up the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "init grid, layers\n",
    "\n",
    "each time step: \n",
    "    for i in range(N):\n",
    "        for j in range(N):\n",
    "            central_cell = grid[i,j]\n",

    "            compute the weight of each cell using v_tot\n",

    "            update cell states\n",
    "                remove ic from central cell water level\n",
    "                add weight*ic to downstream cells level\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms are fairly esoteric, and are better explained by specifying the model and demonstration with toy examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The model takes a Digital Elevation Model, stored as a numpy array, as input. For an `(N,N)` input, the preprocessing stage involves the addition of 4 layers to an expanded shape of `(N,N,5)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Layer 1: Ground Level. \n",
    "\n",
    "    This layer is the DEM itself, with no_data values (e.g. -9999) masked out. A DEM represents surface terrain of a landscape using a grid comprising cells, where each cell has a raster size of, say, `30m x 30m`. Data was downloaded using, in one-off excellence for a `.gov` website, [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and converted to a numpy array using the `geotiff` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "    (Figure. Resampling a large DEM: the southern Western Ghats, India)[]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For simulating very large cachements `(>10,000, >10,000)`, the DEM could be resampled using the `resample_array` utility to a more computationally tractable smaller grid size, while retaining the overall topology. As seen in the figure above, however, aggressive resampling creates sheer drops between adjacent cells, which we almost never find in real-world data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Layer 2: Water Columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This layer records the water level of each cell, relative to Ground (DEM) Level. This is the state we will update each time step in the CA. The layer can be initialized to dry cells (i.e. all cells with a water level of 0), or pre-exisitng water levels. Precipitation can be thought of making minor additions to this layer each time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Layer 3: Slope Field. \n",
    "\n",
    "    This records the slope (degrees) of each cell. It measured by considering the Moore neighborhood of each cell, measuring the change along the `row` and `column` directions of the 3x3 window. The slope field can be thought of as cached data to help calculate Manning flow in the transition rules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Layer 4: Directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "    (Figure. Direction Codes for Downstream Neighbors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This records the **directions** of flow for each cell, encoded as an integer between `[0, 255]`. Water in a cell may flow to any of 8 neighboring cells, as long as they are downstream. As such, to find the directions for each cell, we first find the downstream cells, and encode each of their positions in binary. For example, a cell with no downstream neighbors would be stored as `[00000000] = 0`, while a cell with a downstream neighbor in the North and West would be stored as `[00001010] = 10`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Layer 5: Previous Intercellular Volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The previous intercellular volumes for each cell are stored here. At the start of the simulation, this is initialized to 0. This layer is needed to compute the intercellular flow at time step `t+ \\Delta t`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These terms will be explained in the next section on transition rules.\n",

    "Consider a simple physical intuition: when water flows downstream, it chooses the path of least resistance. This rules out water flowing upwards (as it loses energy in the process), so an efficient path must be one of steepest descent. In continous space, we have a wide span of directions to choose for this path. In a CA, however, we have discretized all possible paths into a finite set of (8) directions. To compensate for this loss of granularity, we don't consider a *single* path for the flow, but rather, a series of flow proportions to downstream neighbors. These flow proportions are such that the steepest downstream neighbor receives the largest fraction, while the remaining neighbors receive smaller and smaller fractions in proportion to their lower and lower steepness. In the simplest case, consider the following height differences across 8 neighbors `[0,10,0,5,0,5,0,0]`. The flow proportions are `[0,0.5,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0]`.\n",

    "In this formulation, downstream neigbours may reach heights above the central cell, which causes oscillations in the simulation (Guidolin et al., 2016). To minimize these, we permit the central cell retain a fraction of the total volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{min}}$, the minimum available volume found in neigbours. Unlike the Guidolin et al. formulation, we also set a minimum volume of (1e-4) and maximum volume (1e4) in the event that no downstream neighbor is found. This was found to reduce oscillations in the simulation dramatically."

    "While the above can serve as a simple, \"water balancing\" transition rule, it excludes physical terms that might improve the modeling of flood dynamics.

To introduce these terms, we introduce a new quantity, total intercellular volume $ I_{\\text{tot}}$ $(m^3)$.
