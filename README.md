# Minerva-DataScience
Complies a selection of coursework and projects associated with my Data Science and Statistics concentration at Minerva University

In my CS degree, I had concentrations in three areas: 

1. Complex Systems Modelling

  I had the opportunity to learn how to use advanced modeling methods to study, evaluate and forecast the behavior of physical, economic and social systems. I explored the concepts of portfolio management, traffic flow control and analyzing social networks, through the use of cellular automata, networks and Monte Carlo simulations. I also gained an understanding of both the theoretical and practical components of each of the three frameworks.
  
  For my final project, I simulated rainfall and flooding using real-world data and a cellular automata with shallow water equation update rules.

2. Applied Machine Learning

  In this course, I applied core machine learning techniques, such as classification, perceptron, neural networks, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and nonparametric models of clustering, to make sense of a variety of data. I also learned about concepts such as feature selection, cross-validation and over-fitting. I programmed machine learning algorithms to analyze genetic data, data used to perform customer segmentation and data used to predict the outcome of elections.
  
  For my final project, I replicated the mathematical result of a paper that connected Deep Learning Neural Networks to Gaussian Processes by creating a Deep Learning GP model in numpy, with zero dependencies. I also extended the results by using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler to perform gradient ascent over the log-likelihood. 
    
3. Computational Bayesian Statistics

  In this course,  I studied the fundamentals of Bayesian inference, which is the mathematical framework for using observed data to update our understanding of a system. We explored different real-world scenarios from sports, medicine, vehicle tracking, social sciences, and more, and discussed how the data modeling process can be applied. Additionally, I learned about approximate methods for automating inference, such as variational inference using pyStan and Monte Carlo methods, which can be used for large models and data sets.
  
  For my final project, I forecasted within a 95%CI atmospheric CO2 concentrations based on the Mauna Loa dataset. The model contained paramters to model the long term, seasonal, and noise trends in the original data.
